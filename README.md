# Express starter using Nunjucks template, with BrowserSync, Gulp, and Nodemon integrated.

This is an Express starter app that uses the Nunjucks template, with BrowserSync and Nodemon integrated with Gulp (v4 onwards).

Nodemon monitors your node.js files while browsersync watches your html, css and js. Use them to save time (no more refreshing browser) while developing your nodejs app.

You need [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed on your laptop.

To get started, open your terminal:

1. `git clone git@github.com/davidnge/express-starter-with-nunjucks-browsersync-nodemon.git`

2. `npm install`

3. `gulp` 


**Note:** Remember to set `noCache:false` (configureNunjucks function in app.js) when you push the code to production!
